<h1> Key Learning Points </h1>

1. Using Fetch to call API to retrieve weather data of different cities
2. The usage of document.querySelector to return a first element that matches a specified CSS selector. In this case I am using it to return the following elements to be displayed like 'city', 'description', 'icon', 'temperature' etc.
3. Using addEventListener to enable the program to execute the weather function and retrieve the API data upon "hearing" of the click or Enter buttton.
